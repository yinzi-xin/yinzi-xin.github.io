# About Me

![](/assets/img/website_headshot.jpg)

Hi! I'm a graduate student in physics at Caltech in the Exoplanet Technology Lab led by Professor Dimitri Mawet. My research interests lie in optical and near-infrared instrumentation for the detection, imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanets. Specifically, I look for ways to reduce contamination from starlight, both in hardware and through post-processing with statistical methods.

Previously, I obtained a MS in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT and a BS in Physics from Caltech. I am a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
