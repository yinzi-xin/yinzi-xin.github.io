# About Me

![](/assets/img/website_headshot.jpg)

Hi! I'm a graduate student in physics at Caltech, in the Exoplanet Technology Lab led by Dimitri Mawet. My research interests lie in optical and near-infrared instrumentation for the detection, imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanets. Specifically, I look for ways to reduce contamination from starlight, both in hardware and through post-processing with statistical methods. I am a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
