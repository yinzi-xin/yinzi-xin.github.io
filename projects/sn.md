title: 'Speckle Nulling Through a Single-Mode Fiber'
---

[Speckle nulling](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/498669) is an established technique for destructively interfering starlight with itself by using a deformable mirror to modulate the phase of the light. In Fall 2022, I led the the effort to perform the first on-sky demonstration of speckle nulling through a single-mode fiber with the [Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Astronomical-Telescopes-Instruments-and-Systems/volume-7/issue-03/035006/Keck-Planet-Imager-and-Characterizer--a-dedicated-single-mode/10.1117/1.JATIS.7.3.035006.full) (KPIC) instrument (paper under review). It is also the first demonstration of speckle nulling that uses a high-resolution spectrograph simultaneously for wavefront sensing and for science-grade spectra.

Because speckle nulling relies on a series of probes, we may be able to constrain the level of coherent light based on how it interferes with the probes. This project is currently in-progress, but improving constraints on the coherent light may be helpful in removing the effects of leaked starlight on the data.
