title: 'Photonic Lantern Nulling'
---

I proposed the [Photonic Lantern Nuller](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac9284) (PLN) instrument concept for the efficient detection and spectroscopic characterization of exoplanets within the diffraction limit - a regime inaccessible to conventional coronagraphs. Accessing closer-in separations would greatly increase the expected number of detectable planets, which scales inversely with the inner working angle.

The PLN is a cross-aperture nuller that works by injecting light into a [Mode-Selective Photonic Lantern](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-22-1-1036&id=276906) (MSPL), leveraging the spatial symmetries of the device to cancel out on-axis starlight while letting off-axis planet light through. It was inspired by the [Vortex Fiber Nuller](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae262/pdf) concept - however, a PLN retains more of the planet flux than the VFN because of its multiple ports, so its ideal sensitivity is expected to be higher.

The PLN has been [characterized in the lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01426) in monochromatic and broadband light, and future work includes improving nulls using wavefront sensing and control, as well as an on-sky demonstration.
