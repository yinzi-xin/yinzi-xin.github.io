title: 'Wavefront Control for the Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission'
---

The Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission (DeMi) is a cubesat developed by the STARLab at MIT. It operated from 2020 to 2021 and tested a Microelectromechanical (MEMS) Deformable Mirror in space for the first time, raising its technology readiness level from 5 to 9. I was partly responsible for aligning the payload optics, and I also wrote and tested the wavefront control algorithm, which was successfully used in orbit (see [Morgan et al. 2022](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12185/2630563/On-orbit-operations-summary-for-the-Deformable-Mirror-Demonstration-Mission/10.1117/12.2630563.short) for details).
