title: 'Coronagraphic Data Post-processing Using Projections on Instrumental Modes'
---

Post-processing of coronagraphic data should take advantage of as many sources of information as it can to disentangle residual starlight from planet signal. In [Xin et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1879), I show that an instrument model can be used to predict the wavefront error modes that a coronagraph is most sensitive to, and that this information can be used in post-processing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a planet.
