title: 'Coronagraphic Data Post-processing Using Projections on Instrumental Modes'
---

Post-processing of coronagraphic data should take advantage of as many sources of information as it can to disentangle residual starlight from planet signal. I showed that the instrumental sensitivity of a coronagraph to wavefront error is one such source of information, and can be used to derive [robust observables](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1879) â€” a simple way to implement an instrumental prior that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of a planet.
